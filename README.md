# neural-network
Multi Layer Perceptron neural network with no ML libraries. Uses Genetic Algorithms for optimisation. Written in Python.

* Model has 1 hidden layer with arbitrary neurons.
* Model output layer has 1 neuron.
* Trains with back propagation using gradient descent of the error function.
* Model optimisation is done via a Genetic Evolutionary Algorithm
